- [Exon Extration](https://github.com/ryuzheng/Python-learning/tree/master/Biology/ExonExtraction) (fetch exon sequence from text files like fasta)
- [chr17.fa](https://github.com/ryuzheng/Python-learning/tree/master/Biology/chr17.fa) (to intercept a part of sequence from text files like fasta)
- [merge-files](https://github.com/ryuzheng/Python-learning/tree/master/Biology/merge-files) (merge files in folders with same prefix)
- [phred2quality](https://github.com/ryuzheng/Python-learning/tree/master/Biology/phred2quality) (Not Python(JavaScript), caculate Phred-Score to quality value(pertages) with several types Phred-Score)
